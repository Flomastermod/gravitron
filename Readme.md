# [Gravitron](http://gravitron.surge.sh/)

this is a little game I'm cooking up, written in [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io), using [Reprocessing](https://github.com/Schmavery/reprocessing) (a cross-platform opengl-backed 2d-graphics library).

Try it out at http://gravitron.surge.sh/, and tell me what you think!

Download the osx native version from the [releases](https://github.com/jaredly/gravitron/releases) page.
